      "I am not sure what to make of this. I have been told that it means “dog” in Russian, but there are no dogs here and we don’t speak any language other than English or Spanish (and even then only very little). It was written on my doorstep with chalk. There were also some strange symbols drawn around me as well. They looked like they might be runes from an ancient culture, perhaps Norse? But why would anyone do such things? And who could possibly know about them if so few people can read them anymore? Perhaps someone has come back through time just for us…or maybe something else entirely!
